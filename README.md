# memorymigrationshinyapp
Memory Migration Shiny App

Our goal is to develop and study a model which blends a *tactical* (i.e. direct response to resource availability or perception) and a *strategic* (i.e. memory-driven and forward-thinking) behavior for a migratory population in a discontinuous, pulsed environment.  The overarching question is *under what conditions does memory help an animal adapt to changing environmental conditions*. 

This Shiny App allows for exploration of the model.
